#DeadlineX

**DeadlineX** is a student-focused deadline management app designed to help students never miss an assignment again. Built specifically for academic work, it allows students to **add, edit, and track assignment deadlines** with precise dates and times, attach files, and mark tasks as completed. Assignments are visually organized using **color-coded urgency levels, a calendar view, and a dashboard with charts** that clearly show workload distribution. DeadlineX is **simple, fast, and distraction-free**; works offline (except for optional AI features); and is built with a clean **light and dark mode** to suit student preferences. By turning deadline tracking into a clear and visual experience, DeadlineX reduces stress and helps students stay organized and on time.
